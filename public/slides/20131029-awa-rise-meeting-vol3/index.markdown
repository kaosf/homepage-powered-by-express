* can rollback to all commits
* can detect errors immediately


## a question to audience


## question

Do you do backup like YYYYMMDD-XXX.zip?


## response to answer

If you do, it's too waste.

If you don't, it's too dangerous.


## response to "No, I'm using VCS"

Very good!


## for remote working

We want to make Git (or other VCS) to be  
more famous and generally.

...like Excel!


## thanks

We want designers and programmers who can use Git.

If you can't, please come to Git Handson!
